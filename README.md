A website that I made for my father who is an artist.

This is a very basic website containing basic info and a gallery of paintings. I made the design several years ago when I was still a beginner in html/css. Recently I added a script to automatically load all the paintings contained in the /images folder. Also added some responsiveness. I plan to remake the website from scratch though using Ruby on Rails or some other framework.
